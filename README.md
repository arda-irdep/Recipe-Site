## Usage

Step 1: Clone the repository
To get a copy of this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

    Open your terminal or command prompt.
    Navigate to the directory where you want to store this project (e.g., ~/Documents).
    Type the following command and press Enter:

git clone https://github.com/arda-irdep/Recipe_Website.git

Step 2: Change into the folder
After cloning the repository, navigate into the newly created folder using the following command:

cd Recipe_Website

This should take you inside the project's main working directory.

Step 3: Installing Flask:
Flask is a popular microframework written in Python that helps us build web applications quickly and efficiently. If you haven't done so yet, make sure Flask is installed in your system by executing the following command:

    pip install Flask

Step 4: Run Flask application
Now, you can start the Flask development server by running the following command:

    flask run

This command starts the Flask application at http://localhost:5000 or http://127.0.0.1:5000 which is the default address assigned to this port number on your computer. You may see some output messages from Flask as it initializes the application. Once everything looks good, open a web browser and visit http://localhost:5000 or http://127.0.0.1:5000. If all goes well, you should be greeted by the homepage of this project!
