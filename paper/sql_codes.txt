VALUES ('Spaghetti Carbonara', 'Spaghetti, eggs, pancetta, Parmesan cheese, black pepper', 'Prepare the Ingredients:        Cut the guanciale or pancetta into small pieces.        In a bowl, whisk together the eggs and grated Pecorino Romano cheese. Add a generous amount of freshly cracked black pepper. Mix until well combined. Set aside.    Cook the Pasta:        Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt once it is boiling and then add the spaghetti. Cook according to the package instructions until al dente.        Reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water before draining.    Cook the Guanciale/Pancetta:        While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the guanciale or pancetta and cook until it is crispy and the fat has rendered, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat.    Combine the Pasta and Guanciale/Pancetta:        Quickly add the drained spaghetti to the skillet with the guanciale or pancetta. Toss to coat the pasta in the fat.    Make the Carbonara Sauce:        Remove the skillet from the heat to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the pasta, tossing continuously with tongs or a fork to create a creamy sauce. Add the reserved pasta water a little at a time to achieve the desired consistency. The heat from the pasta will gently cook the eggs, thickening them into a creamy sauce.    Final Seasoning:        Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt if needed and plenty of black pepper.    Serve Immediately:        Serve the pasta hot, garnished with additional grated Pecorino Romano and more black pepper if desired.', 15, 20);
